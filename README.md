# CRCDDoS2022
# Developing Realistic Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Dataset for Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems
## During the last decade, attackers have compromised reputable systems to launch massive Distributed Denial
of Services (DDoS) attacks against banking services, corporate
websites, and e-commerce business. Such attacks cause enormous
reputation and financial losses which ruined their services to
authorized users. Conventionally, diverse solutions have been
proposed to combat emerging DDoS attacks. However, there
is no ideal solution available to-date. To validate majority of
the existing solutions, researchers have considered simulation
based experiments that become obsolete. Now a days, the trend
has shifted to publicly available realistic datasets for DDoS
validation purpose. Thus, in this research study, we have provided
a comprehensive review of currently available datasets and
proposed a novel taxonomy for classification of DDoS attacks.
Further, we generated a new dataset called “CRCDDoS2022”,
which can overcome all existing shortcomings. Moreover, a novel
generated dataset “CRCDDoS2022” can overcome shortcomings.
Moreover, with this new dataset, a new attack (Malware) family
classification and detection approach is also provided which based
on the set of features in network flow. Lastly, this research
provided the most significant feature sets for the detection of
DDoS attacks of various types along with their corresponding
weights
